# RevivePlus
RevivePlus is an plugin for survival/faction/smp servers. 

i made this plugin in a few minutes so dont expect it to be perfect <3
> (still kinda WIP)

# Description.
this plugin makes a player lay on the ground when he dies, during this time he cannot do anything until he's revived.
You can revive players by standing in a 5 block radius of them (configurable).

# Issues
> Currently none. (i havent tested the plugin out yet lol)
